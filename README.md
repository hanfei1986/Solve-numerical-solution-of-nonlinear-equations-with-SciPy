# Solve-numerical-solution-of-nonlinear-equations-with-SciPy
In some cases, solving nonlinear equations analytically is extremly difficult. SciPy provides a fsolve function which uses the iterative method to solve the equations numerically.

When light transmits a material and the angle of incidence is non-zero, the S-polarized and P-polarized lights propagate along different routes. This is called birefringence:

The absorption coefficient of the material can be calculated by subtracting reflectance and transmittance from 100:

Alternatively, the absorption coefficient of the material
